<h1 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h1>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left;">This web site is about me, Selwyn C. Williams Jr. It is an informational page 
about who I am.
I would like to give some background information about me and about some of the things that I enjoy.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left;">I was born in St. Louis, MO, in 1981, but I have spent my life living in Illinois.
I grew up as the oldest of four children to Annette and Selwyn Williams Sr. We grew up in East St. Louis,
 which is where my parents reside today.
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left;">The name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selwyn">"Selwyn"</a> means 
	friend of the manor, or loosely translated to mean, good friend. My grandmother got the name from
a woman who was pregnant at the same time that my grandmother was.  This woman was going to name her child, Selwyn, if she had a boy. The woman had a girl,
but my grandmother told her that since she was having a son that she would use the name. They remain in contact for years after this.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:left;">I have been currently married for 8 years to a lovely lady named Erin. We have one child who is named Selwyn III,
also known as "3-peat"</p>
